# Overused Grotesk
Do you want a free alternative to Helvetica because you refuse to pay good money for high-quality typefaces, or that you think neo-grotesk Swiss-like type design is peak minimalism? Then this is probably a good choice.

Overused Grotesk is heavily based off the classic neo-grotesque type design, especially the epic look of the ubiquitous typeface, Helvetica. It may look like the other thousand neo-grotesque typefaces out there, but I can guarantee that "it has its own charm and uniqueness".

If you like this typeface, download it, store it in your library, use it, share it with someone.

## Plans
- Circled + squared numbers
- Ligatures (not necessary)
- Cyrillic next?
- Building more accented letters (Latin-specific)
- More currency symbols
- Kerning (LATIN, NUMBERS, etc.)
- New widths? Compressed + Condensed + Extended + ExtraExtended (build Compressed & ExtraExtended then just interpolate from there)
- Italics, definitely. Just need to make the Upright version first.
- Hinting (might just use ttfautohint)
- Webfont support + css code
- New styles? Mono, Text, Micro? maybe not yet
